The idea behind is to get .txt file from crashed.nu, put it into same folder as the bot and run python main.py. And enjoy the show!
The bot is completely working.

Setup instruction

1. git clone ssh or https
2. write your personal info in main.py for email and password. Note: although the variable name is email, you should write it without @nu.edu.kz. Example, email = firstName.lastName
3. Go to crashed.nu and create the schedule you want.
4. After creating the schedule, press three dots and export it as .txt file.
5. Put the exported "schedule.txt" file into "RegisterBot" folder.
6. Create virtual environment. Optional
7. in terminal, use "pip install -r requirements.txt"
8. Run the main.py using terminal "python main.py" or other means like VSCode runner.
9. Enjoy the show:)
